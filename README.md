# Financial-Calculator

### Description

I started this project because I wanted to answer one basic question:

_Is it financially smarter to spend your extra money paying down your mortgage via additional principal payments, or invest the extra money in something like an index fund etf?_

This problem gets complicated once you start factoring in things like:

- inflation
- home appreciation rate in your area
- your interest rate
- your home purchase price
- changes in your income over time
